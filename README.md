# Meka Static Website Portfolio

---

## Overview

This repository contains a static website portfolio showcasing my front-end development skills using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Bootstrap 4.5.2**. The project features a home page with interactive image icons that link to four distinct sections: **Advanced Technologies**, **Diwali Celebration**, **Happy Meals**, and **News of the Day**. Each section demonstrates unique styling and layouts, highlighting my ability to create responsive and visually appealing web pages.

The live version of this project is deployed at **[mekastatic.ccbp.tech](http://mekastatic.ccbp.tech)**, where you can explore the full functionality.
